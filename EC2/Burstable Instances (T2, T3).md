> T2, T3 machines

So each instance T Type has given burst credits.

### Standard

If the CPU usage meets the max, the instance consumes the burst credits, and if used all the credits, the CPU utilization drops and might also drop the performance.

After all, based on the usage accumulation, the burst credit gets restored to certain amount.

### Unlimited

Gives unlimited burst credit, so will not drop any performance, but additional payment for the additional consumed burst credit.
