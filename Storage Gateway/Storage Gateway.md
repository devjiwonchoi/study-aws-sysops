**Bridge between on-premises data and cloud data**

### S3 File Gateway

Use NFS or SMB protocol to gateway then HTTPS to [[S3]]
Most recent used data is cached in gateway

### FSx File Gateway

Local cache for frequent used data

### Volume Gateway

Cached volumes - low latency across most recent data
Stored volumes - entire dataset is on premise, schedule backups to S3

### Tape Gateway

ChatGPT:

using virtual tape libraries. This service is designed to help organizations transition from physical tape backups to cloud-based storage for data archiving and backup purposes.

Here's how AWS Storage Gateway Tape Gateway works:

1. **Virtual Tape Libraries (VTLs):** Tape Gateway presents a virtual tape library to your on-premises applications. This virtual library is essentially a collection of virtual tapes, each with its own barcode.
    
2. **Tape Storage in the Cloud:** When data is written to these virtual tapes, AWS Storage Gateway backs up the data to Amazon S3 or Amazon Glacier, providing durable and cost-effective storage in the cloud.
    
3. **Backup and Archive:** Tape Gateway is commonly used for long-term data archival, data recovery, and backup. It allows you to manage your data in the cloud as if you were working with physical tapes.
    
4. **Data Retrieval:** You can retrieve data from your virtual tapes on-demand, and AWS retrieves the data from your cloud storage. The retrieval time might vary depending on your chosen storage class (S3 or Glacier) and the retrieval option you select.
    
5. **Cost-Efficiency:** The Tape Gateway service is designed to be cost-effective, and it eliminates the need to manage and maintain physical tapes and tape infrastructure.
    

AWS Storage Gateway Tape Gateway can be useful for organizations that have compliance requirements for data retention or need a cost-effective and scalable solution for data archiving and long-term backup. It provides a bridge between on-premises applications and cloud-based storage without significant changes to your existing backup processes.
