JSON or YAML

Used to:

1. Run command
2. state manage
3. patch manage
4. automation
5. parameter store

What i think it is good is not only I can store commands but no need to expose port 22 and use SSH in order to run commands, or use Connect, but just run by SSM and will run the commands, also works on multiple instances at once!
